            <h2>History is Happening Now</h2>
            <p>The Museum of Modern Ceramics is dedicated to the research, study, and preservation of contemporary
                ceramic art <em>before</em> it can be lost to the sands of time. Support our mission to keep ceramic
                history alive for future generations.</p>

            <h2>Exhibitions</h2>
            <p>We hold three large exhibitions per calendar year. After each exhibition ends, its contents are relocated
                to our secure underground vault, never to be displayed again. This ensures the minimum possible risk of
                a work falling and breaking in the distant future.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>We employ a vast army of in-house research staff, whose responsibilities include:<br>
                Studying contemporary ceramic artists in their natural habitat<br>
                Acquiring new pieces for exhibition<br>
                Regularly publishing their findings in our quarterly journal <cite>Modern Ceramics</cite>

            <h2>Plan a Tour</h2>
            <p>We offer guided tours seven days a week, with flexible options for solo visitors, families, and school
                groups. Visitors are encouraged to look at all works currently on display, though touching is not
                allowed.</p>
