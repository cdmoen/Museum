                        <p><strong>Material:</strong> Wood (species undetermined; likely maple or birch based on grain
                            and coloration)</p>
                        <p><strong>Size/Weight/Shape:</strong> Approx. 9 cm in length; ovular curvature on right side,
                            straight edge on left and bottom; pointed top-left corner; central perforation (∅ ~1 cm) for
                            suspension or grip</p>
                        <p><strong>Physical Properties:</strong> Smooth, slightly porous surface with embedded
                            particulate matter; tactile residue consistent with clay handling; faint scent of kiln dust
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> Estimated at one (1) year, inferred from wear patterns, grain
                            expansion due to moisture, and contextual placement among active tools</p>
                        <p><strong>Preservation State:</strong> Structurally intact and functionally viable; surface
                            finish degraded from repeated exposure to water and rotational friction</p>
                        <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Recovered from ceramicist habitat (Studio Site 4B); GPS
                            coordinates withheld per ethical surveillance protocol</p>
                        <p><strong>Found With:</strong> Clustered among shaping, cutting, and smoothing implements;
                            spatial density suggests designation as high-activity zone</p>

                        <p><strong>Likely Purpose:</strong> Utilitarian tool for shaping clay on rotational apparatus
                            (commonly referred to as "wheel"); used to refine contours and remove excess material</p>
                        <p><strong>Evidence of Use:</strong> Frictional wear along curved edge; grain swelling from
                            water exposure; finish erosion consistent with repeated immersion and abrasive contact</p>
                        <p><strong>Manufacture Clues:</strong> Single-piece construction with no decorative elements;
                            absence of branding or maker’s mark suggests artisanal or small-batch origin, possibly
                            improvised or locally sourced</p>
                        <p><strong>Burial or Habitat Context:</strong> Located within ceramicist dwelling (Studio 4B);
                            spatial analysis and proximity to wheel suggest central role in daily ritualized production
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> No overt symbolic markings; object appears purely functional,
                            though its wear implies ritualistic repetition and embodied knowledge</p>
                        <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> Closely resembles standardized pottery ribs in institutional
                            collections; minor variations in curvature and grip aperture suggest adaptation to user
                            preference or hand size</p>

                        <p><strong>Physical Properties:</strong> Garments exhibit staining in multiple regions; several
                            items heavily marked. A faint organic odor emanates from the vessel, consistent with

                        <p><strong>Likely Purpose:</strong> Primarily functional garments used for daily wear. A subset
                            of items appears more adorned and less worn, suggesting ceremonial or presentational use.
                            The absence of stains on these pieces implies intentional preservation for social or ritual
                            occasions</p>
                        <p><strong>Evidence of Use:</strong> Staining, fabric thinning, and structural degradation
                            observed. Rear pockets of trousers and underarm regions show concentrated wear. Scuff marks
                            and faded coloration indicate repeated laundering and bodily contact</p>
                        <p><strong>Manufacture Clues:</strong> Most garments contain tags indicating mass production.
                            Tags are faded or illegible due to repeated washing. Stitching patterns and fabric types
                            suggest industrial manufacture</p>

                        <p><strong>Burial or Habitat Context:</strong> Domestic dwelling, specifically a non-commercial,

                    <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                    <p>
                        This ensemble reflects domestic labor, hygiene, and ritualized clothing practices. Heavily
                        worn garments reveal daily bodily labor, while cleaner items suggest ceremonial or
                        presentational preservation. The container mediates storage and odor, creating a microcosm
                        of domestic rhythms. Oral tradition refers to these garments as “The Waiting Clothes,”
                        symbolizing presence, absence, and aspirational identity. The interpretive tension lies in
                        simultaneous utility and symbolic meaning: practical wear coexists with deliberate
                        preservation, marking social or ritual intent.

                    <h4>Comparative Notes</h4>
                    <p>
                        Comparable garments are typical of 21st-century mass production, yet the combination of worn
                        and preserved pieces, alongside containerized storage, distinguishes this ensemble as
                        culturally informative of domestic labor practices.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Specific selection criteria for preservation remain unknown; symbolic interpretations must
                        be tempered with evidence-based observations of wear and residue.

                        The collection invites reflection on how everyday clothing embodies labor, identity, and
                        care, providing insight into the rhythms and materiality of domestic life supporting
                        creative practice.

        <h2 id="modal-title">Wooden Potter's Rib</h2>
        <p>~1 year old | Studio Site 4B | Wood (likely maple or birch)</p>
        <p>
            This single-piece rib, approx. 9 cm in length with a curved edge and central perforation, was recovered from
            a high-activity shaping zone. Embedded clay residues and subtle grain swelling from moisture indicate
            repeated contact with wheel-thrown forms. While lacking decorative markings, minor variations in curvature
            and grip suggest adaptation to the maker’s hand, implying both functional and ritualized use. Studio lore
            refers to it as the “Rib of Many Shapes,” a silent witness to vessels past, its smooth surface bearing the
            imprint of repetitive gestures. Interpretive tension arises between its mass-produced-like uniformity and
            intimate wear, highlighting the paradox of ordinary tools carrying extraordinary personal imprint. Handle
            with care; the tactile traces it retains are considered essential to understanding the choreography of
            studio labor.

        <h2 id="modal-title">Apron</h2>
        <p>Cotton, approx. 85 × 70 cm | Studio Site 4B</p>
        <p>
            Recovered draped over benches and tools, this “trucker’s apron” bears iron-rich clay stains and dried slip,
            though fabric wear is surprisingly light. Its intermittent use suggests both practical protection and
            performative signaling—a symbolic assertion of studio responsibility. Some call it “The Pretender’s Cloak,”
            acknowledging the paradox between appearance of diligence and uneven actual use. The apron’s pragmatic
            origin and functional design highlight economic considerations within craft practice, while heavy staining
            records repeated gestures of handling clay. Observers are cautioned against prolonged contact; stains
            preserve the material memory of embodied labor and ritualized touch.

        <p>
            ~1+ year use | Studio Site 4B | Synthetic material
        </p>
        <p>
            Submerged in a bucket of porcelain slip, this rectangular sponge (12 × 6 × 4 in) shows wet, soft degradation
            alongside embedded clay, dust, and metal particles. Initially assumed to serve ceramics alone, analysis
            suggests polyvalent cleaning use, reflecting both specificity and general studio maintenance. Studio legend
            names it “The Absorber,” said to hold the residue of errors and oversight. Its pliant form and partial
            collapse index repeated physical labor, yet the ambiguity of its function captures a tension between
            intentionality and improvisation. Slight mold presence advises cautious observation. As a mundane implement,
            it nevertheless embodies the quiet, necessary labor that underpins visible creative output.

        <h2 id="modal-title">Empty Bowl and Spoon</h2>
        <p>
            2010s mass-produced | Domestic quarters Site 4B-D | Ceramic and stainless steel</p>
        <p>
            This mid-fire grey bowl with clear glaze, 15 cm in diameter, and accompanying spoon show cutlery marks, rim
            chipping, and dulled polish. Dried bovine milk residue indicates recent consumption and situates the objects
            in routines of domestic nourishment. Their placement atop communal lounging surfaces contrasts with the
            industrious studio, highlighting domestic microcosms of rest and care. Dubbed the “Communal Vessel” in
            studio lore, they bear traces of both individual and shared activity. Interpretive tension emerges from
            their mundane production and deeply personal imprint: ordinary objects carrying intimate, ephemeral human
            traces.

        <h2 id="modal-title">Used Garments in Vessel</h2>
        <p>Mixed textiles, 4–6 kg | Domestic interior Site 4B-D | Plastic container</p>
        <p>
            Contained within a vented plastic vessel, these garments range from heavily worn and stained to preserved,
            suggesting both daily function and ceremonial or presentational selection. Underarm and pocket wear
            indicates habitual gestures, while some cleaner items imply intentional preservation for ritualized or
            social contexts. Studio oral tradition calls them “The Waiting Clothes,” signaling presence, absence, and
            aspiration. Interpretive tension arises between utility and symbolism, wear and preservation. Observers are
            cautioned regarding organic odors; the ensemble embodies domestic labor, hygiene, and the subtle interplay
            of practical necessity and personal identity.

        <h2 id="modal-title">Notebook Pages</h2>
        <p>~5 years old | Domestic shelving Site 4B | Paper with dotted grid, graphite and ink</p>
        <p>
            Slightly off-white pages (11 × 7 in) carry spontaneous, non-linear entries ranging from ceramic formulas to
            personal reflections. Water damage and clay dust reveal studio transport, while informal shelving placement
            suggests domestic cross-use. The notebook has been called “The Oracle of Slip and Thought,” thought to
            capture fleeting ideas before they vanish. Interpretive tension arises in the juxtaposition of technical
            rigor and personal intimacy, revealing layered cognitive processes. Its legibility and wear reflect repeated
            handling, preserving traces of experimentation, memory, and improvisational thought. Handle with care; the
            notebook holds delicate, ephemeral insight into the creative mind.
