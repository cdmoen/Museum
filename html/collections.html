                        <p><strong>Material:</strong> Wood (species undetermined; likely maple or birch based on grain

                        <p><strong>Size/Weight/Shape:</strong> Approx. 9 cm in length; ovular curvature on right side,
                            straight edge on left and bottom; pointed top-left corner; central perforation (∅ ~1 cm) for
                            suspension or grip</p>
                        <p><strong>Physical Properties:</strong> Smooth, slightly porous surface with embedded
                            particulate matter; tactile residue consistent with clay handling; faint scent of kiln dust
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> Estimated at one (1) year, inferred from wear patterns, grain
                            expansion due to moisture, and contextual placement among active tools</p>
                        <p><strong>Preservation State:</strong> Structurally intact and functionally viable; surface
                            finish degraded from repeated exposure to water and rotational friction</p>
                        <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Recovered from ceramicist habitat (Studio Site 4B); GPS
                            coordinates withheld per ethical surveillance protocol</p>
                        <p><strong>Found With:</strong> Clustered among shaping, cutting, and smoothing implements;
                            spatial density suggests designation as high-activity zone</p>

                        <p><strong>Likely Purpose:</strong> Utilitarian tool for shaping clay on rotational apparatus
                            (commonly referred to as "wheel"); used to refine contours and remove excess material</p>
                        <p><strong>Evidence of Use:</strong> Frictional wear along curved edge; grain swelling from
                            water exposure; finish erosion consistent with repeated immersion and abrasive contact</p>
                        <p><strong>Manufacture Clues:</strong> Single-piece construction with no decorative elements;
                            absence of branding or maker’s mark suggests artisanal or small-batch origin, possibly
                            improvised or locally sourced</p>
                        <p><strong>Burial or Habitat Context:</strong> Located within ceramicist dwelling (Studio 4B);
                            spatial analysis and proximity to wheel suggest central role in daily ritualized production
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> No overt symbolic markings; object appears purely functional,
                            though its wear implies ritualistic repetition and embodied knowledge</p>
                        <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> Closely resembles standardized pottery ribs in institutional
                            collections; minor variations in curvature and grip aperture suggest adaptation to user
                            preference or hand size</p>

                            prolonged accumulation</p>
                        <p><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> Items vary in age; inferred from wear patterns and textile
                            degradation. Some garments show signs of long-term use, others appear more recent</p>
                        <p><strong>Preservation State:</strong> Mixed condition. Several garments exhibit damage
                            including holes and fraying; others remain structurally intact but are visibly stained</p>
                        <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Recovered from a domestic interior chamber believed to serve
                            transitional hygienic and preparatory functions (Site 4B-D; coordinates withheld for
                            privacy)</p>
                        <p><strong>Found With:</strong> Located among other domestic artifacts including grooming tools,
                            towels, and hygiene-related items. Context supports interpretation as a private living space

                        <p><strong>Likely Purpose:</strong> Primarily functional garments used for daily wear. A subset
                            of items appears more adorned and less worn, suggesting ceremonial or presentational use.
                            The absence of stains on these pieces implies intentional preservation for social or ritual
                            occasions</p>
                        <p><strong>Evidence of Use:</strong> Staining, fabric thinning, and structural degradation
                            observed. Rear pockets of trousers and underarm regions show concentrated wear. Scuff marks
                            and faded coloration indicate repeated laundering and bodily contact</p>
                        <p><strong>Manufacture Clues:</strong> Most garments contain tags indicating mass production.
                            Tags are faded or illegible due to repeated washing. Stitching patterns and fabric types
                            suggest industrial manufacture</p>

                        <p><strong>Burial or Habitat Context:</strong> Domestic dwelling, specifically a non-commercial,
                            non-industrial interior space used for rest and personal maintenance</p>
                        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> No overt symbolic markings or branding. Garments appear selected
                            for utility rather than aesthetic or status signaling. Suggests wearer did not prioritize
                            clothing as a form of personal expression or social display</p>
                        <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> Denim trousers resemble those of a well-known manufacturer,
                            though branding is unconfirmed. Other garments are consistent with mass-produced clothing
                            found in similar domestic contexts</p>

                        <p><strong>Material:</strong> Paper with faint dotted grid matrix; inscriptions in graphite,
                            blue ink, and black ink</p>
                        <p><strong>Size/Weight/Shape:</strong> Rectangular sheets measuring approximately 11 × 7 inches
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Physical Properties:</strong> Slightly off-white paper with a dotted grid pattern.
                            Writing includes a mix of graphite pencil and ink in blue and black.</p>
                        <p><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> Estimated to be within the past five years, based on ink
                            composition and contextual clues</p>
                        <p><strong>Preservation State:</strong> Generally intact. Ink on several pages has been
                            compromised by moisture, but the majority of the text remains legible. Pages show minor wear
                            consistent with regular handling</p>
                        <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Recovered from a domestic shelving unit within living
                            quarters, among a loosely arranged pile of other written materials</p>
                        <p><strong>Found With:</strong> Located alongside other papers, books, and handwritten notes in
                            a domestic shelving unit. Arrangement was informal and lacked clear organizational structure

                        <p><strong>Likely Purpose:</strong> Recording notes. Several ntries include material names and
                            temperature symbols, suggesting use in ceramic or studio-based processes. Other entries are
                            personal in nature.</p>
                        <p><strong>Evidence of Use:</strong> Water damage and clay dust residue indicate the notebook
                            was brought into a working studio. Its location among personal effects suggests it was also
                            referenced during non-working hours. Likely served as a general-purpose journal across
                            multiple contexts</p>
                        <p><strong>Manufacture Clues:</strong> No watermarks or proprietary symbols detected. Paper and
                            binding consistent with mass-produced stationery products</p>

                        <p><strong>Burial or Habitat Context:</strong> Domestic living quarters; not a formal archive or
                            workspace</p>
                        <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Writing style and page layout suggest spontaneity and non-linear
                            thought processes. Juxtaposition of unrelated entries implies a fluid, improvisational
                            approach to documentation</p>
                        <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> Dot-grid paper of this size and format aligns with popular
                            contemporary stationery brands. Writing instruments and ink types are common and
                            unremarkable in modern contexts</p>
