                <h3>Senior Research Fellow, Department of Archaeology</h3>
                <p>
                    Educated at the University of Vienna with a PhD in Archaeological Praxis, Dr. Kröschwald serves as
                    our
                    museum's Principal Archaeologist of Contemporary Ceramic Environments. Focusing on the forensic
                    cataloging of tools, material remnants, and spatial
                    configurations within active ceramic studios, his research reconstructs artisanal epistemologies
                    through
                    close analysis of brush fiber residues, glaze particulate stratification, and stratified wheel mud
                    deposits, which he interprets as chronological indicators of creative intensity. Kröschwald's
                    contributions to Embedded Studio Archaeometry have garnered international attention, particularly
                    following his high-resolution mapping of a rooftop workspace in Jingdezhen. He remains a vocal
                    advocate
                    for immersive, proximity-based documentation as a means of interpreting the infrastructural essence
                    of
                    creative labor.

                <h2>Calder Voss</h2>
                <h3>Field Operative, Anthropology Dept.</h3>
                <p>
                    Calder Voss is a recognized authority in high-stakes artifact recovery and cultural fieldwork,
                    renowned
                    for his precision, reliability, and nuanced understanding of sociocultural landscapes. With a career
                    forged outside academic institutions, he honed his expertise through years of direct engagement in
                    complex environments — developing a reputation for resolving logistical and diplomatic challenges
                    with
                    surgical clarity. Voss is frequently sought out by private archives, historical trusts, and curators
                    for
                    projects involving rare or endangered materials. His work is defined by its ethical discretion,
                    operational rigor, and an unmistakable respect for the communities and cultures he encounters.
                    Though
                    independent, he has earned informal accolades across institutions for his contributions to
                    acquisition
                    strategy and preservation.

                <h2>Sylvette Thorne, PhD</h2>
                <h3>Contemporary Cultural Historian</h3>
                <p>
                    Educated at the Sorbonne and later at Goldsmiths, University of London, Dr. Sylvette Thorne holds a
                    PhD
                    in Cultural Semiotics with a concentration in Art Labor Analysis. Her interpretive framework draws
                    from
                    post-structuralist theory and cultural epistemology, with an emphasis on decoding symbolic traces
                    left
                    behind in creative environments. She specializes in constructing cultural narratives from physical
                    remnants, often identifying psychological and aesthetic patterns invisible to first-pass analysis.
                    Passionate about understanding how artifacts reflect deeper meaning, she refers to herself as a
                    “disciple of invisible gestures”—interpreting what cannot be seen but was clearly felt.
