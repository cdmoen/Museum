                <p>The Museum of Modern Ceramics is dedicated to the research, study, and preservation of contemporary
                    ceramic art <em>before</em> it can be lost to the sands of time. Support our mission to keep ceramic
                    history alive for future generations.</p>

                We hold three large exhibitions per calendar year. After each exhibition ends, its contents are
                relocated
                to our secure underground vault, never to be displayed again. This ensures the minimum possible risk
                of a work falling and breaking in the distant future.

                We employ a vast army of in-house research staff, whose responsibilities include:
                Studying contemporary ceramic artists in their natural habitat
                Acquiring new pieces for exhibition
                Regularly publishing their findings in our quarterly journal <cite>Modern Ceramics</cite>

                We offer guided tours seven days a week, with flexible options for solo visitors, families, and
                school groups. Visitors are encouraged to look at all works currently on display, though
                touching is
                not allowed.
